# PracticeProjects
Projects I work on to improve my own skill.

App Starter GUI: Loads executable applications into a list, runs all loaded applications with 1 button. Saves loaded list for future use.

Login System GUI: What started as an expirement to test my GUI creation capabilities expanded to become a fully functioning Login System. Passwords HASHED and SALTED. Database of users and passwords placed in a HashMap at startup to make login and register times faster.

Trainee Training Document Creation Script: An efficient solution to a problem bogging down my eSport's community's recruitment officers. Trainees are added to checklists, documents automatically created for them, and more all with the submittion of 1 form.
